# Player-Followers
## Basically enemies are spawned at different intervals of time.
## Number of enemies depends on which wave is going on at the current moment.
## Enemies will start following player as soon as they are spawned and try to push it off the island.
## Player can increase its power to pust enemies away by collecting randomly spawned powerup indicators.
## Camera's focal point is attached with player so the horizontal keys are used to move camera accordingly.
## Vertical keys are used to control the movement of player to stay on island.
